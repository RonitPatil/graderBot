# Grader Bot Using Lyzr Automata

## Purpose

In this App we'll explore how to integrate Lyzr's SDK with Streamlit to build a transcription bot for instagram reels and youtube shorts.

## Getting Started
Initially you need to get your openAI API key and assign it to the empty variable "OPENAI_API_KEY" in secrets.toml. 

Follow these steps to run the Lyzr searchAgent Streamlit App locally:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run grader.py

## About Lyzr
Lyzr is the simplest agent framework to help customers build and launch Generative AI apps faster. It is a low-code agent framework that follows an **‘agentic’** way to build LLM apps, contrary to Langchain’s ‘functions and chains’ way and DSPy’s ‘programmatic’ way of building LLM apps.
